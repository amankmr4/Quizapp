# Quizapp
I have web quiz using html bootstrap javascript and also with Jquery. This will have only 2 html files on which all all data will be displayed for the quiz. This is a quiz with 5 question and when the answer is incorrect the timer will be subtracted by 10. The quiz will end once either the timer runs out of the questions have all gone past. It also uses localstorage to save and delete the highscores.
